## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kk-sg/basic-conversation-chatbot.git
cd basic-conversation-chatbot
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Version

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Run the basic version:
```
streamlit run basic.py
```

### Improved Version

1. Run the improved version:
```
streamlit run better_layout.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted in the web interface.

4. Start chatting with the AI!

Alternatively, you can use the live demo of the improved version at [https://basic-conversation-chatbot.streamlit.app](https://basic-conversation-chatbot.streamlit.app)

## Security Note

- For the basic version, ensure your `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally sharing your API key.
- The improved version (`better_layout.py`) requires users to input their own OpenAI API key in the web interface. This key is used only for the current session and is not stored by the application, ensuring the security of your API credentials.
